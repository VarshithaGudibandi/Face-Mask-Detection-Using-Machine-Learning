# Face Mask Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time **face mask detection system** using **OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, and MobileNetV2**. It is designed to help detect whether an individual is wearing a face mask in public settings, contributing to health and safety compliance.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time face mask detection via webcam
- Deep learning model trained on an augmented dataset
- High accuracy (98%) with MobileNetV2
- Compatible with various colored masks and different face orientations
- Uses OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow & Keras
- MobileNetV2 (for transfer learning)
- Jupyter Notebook (for training)
